Condensed matter is a branch of physics where we study about the condensed or solid state (as opposed to gaseous states) of matter. We are surrounded by various matter.

The classical properties, like thermal conductivity, heat capacity etc. are determined by the electronic structure too. A detailed understanding of the electronic structure through microscopic investigations, along with theoretical analysis, is necessary in understanding and engineering new materials allowing for tunable control of their properties. The electronic states in a material is described by energy, momentum, and spin of the electrons. Photoemission spectroscopy: Photoemission spectroscopy is the most powerful, and the only tool available to directly probe the electronic structure of a material. Photoemission spectroscopy is based on the principle of photo-electric effect, in which the sample under investigation is irradiated with a beam of photon (laboratory discharge lamp or x-ray source or synchrotron light sources). If the energy of the incident photon (h\\nu) (h\\nu) is large enough for the electron to overcome its binding energy and the work function of the material, an electron is emitted from the material, and can be detected by an electron spectrometer. The electron spectrometer records the kinetic energy of such electrons detected in a particular angle. The angular information is directly related to the momentum of the electron while inside the material. This in tern, let us learn about the full electronic bands inside the material. Figure: Schematic of the photoemission process. The density of states of outgoing electrons is proportional to that of the material. This schematic is taken from the Hufner's book. Let us consider a material which has the above electronic structure: it has two core levels, and valence band near the Fermi energy. Now, if we measure the intensity distribution of photo emitted electrons as a function of electronic kinetic energy, we would see something like shown in above figure. It is straight forward that the photoemission intensity is proportional the density of electronic states of the material, however, the spectra is broadened due to the finite resolution of the experimental technique. Before the photon is absorbed by the electron, photon may travel a finite distance inside the material. After the photon is absorbed by the electron, the electron can travel in all direction, however we can detect only the electrons that are coming out of the surface. Also, the mean free path of electron inside a solid is very small. It depends on the kinetic energy of the electron. For UV photons, the typical mean free path is of the order of few angstrom. That is why photoemission spectroscopy in the UV range is extremely surface sensitive. Now, the most important question is: what information can we obtain about the material by analyzing the energy and emission angle of the photo-emitted electrons. In every physical process, the total energy and momentum of the whole system is conserved. From the energy conservation, we can determine the binding energy of the electronic state from where the electron is photo-excited. And from the momentum conservation, we can determine the momentum vector of the electronic state. Therefore, we can effectively map the bandstructure of a material by ARPES. This single particle assumption of the photoemission process is simplified. In a real material, the electrons are not independent free particles. They are subject to many-body interaction. Therefore, interpreting the band structure from the observed photoemission spectra is not often trivial.

The most commonly used model for the interpretation of photoemission spectra in solids is the so-called three-step model. It breaks up the complicated photoemission process into three steps: (1) the excitation of the photoelectron, (2) its passage through the solid to the surface, and (3) its penetration through the surface into the vacuum, where it is detected. (1) Photo-excitation The probability of electronic transition from the initial state \\mid\\psi_i> \\mid\\psi_i> representing the occupied valence state or core level to a final state \\mid\\psi_f> \\mid\\psi_f> due to the absorption of the photon (of energy h\\nu h\\nu ) can be derived from the first order perturbation theory. According to the Fermi's golden rule, transition probability is given by: W = \\mid <\\psi_f \\mid \\textbf{H}' \\mid \\psi_i>\\mid ^2 \\delta(E_f \u2212 E_i \u2212 h\\nu) W = \\mid <\\psi_f \\mid \\textbf{H}' \\mid \\psi_i>\\mid ^2 \\delta(E_f \u2212 E_i \u2212 h\\nu) where \\textbf{H}' \\textbf{H}' is the perturbation due to the photon.

The second conservation rule in the photo-excitation process is the momentum conservation. In the solid, the momentum conservation can be expressed as, \\textbf{k}_f = \\textbf{k}_i \\pm \\textbf{G} \\textbf{k}_f = \\textbf{k}_i \\pm \\textbf{G} \\textbf{G} \\textbf{G} is the reciprocal lattice vector, and \\textbf{k}_i \\textbf{k}_i and \\textbf{k}_f \\textbf{k}_f are the initial and final state wave vectors. The momentum corresponding to the incident photon is negligible for the photon energies in the UV or soft x-ray range. (2) Transport of the photo-excited electrons to the sample surface A direct relation between the energy and momentum of the electrons detected outside the crystal and those inside the crystal can be established only if the electrons do not loose energy on its way to the surface. Inelastically scattered electrons are practically lost for the band structure determination. The occurrence of a cascade of inelastic scattering processes produces a large number of low energy electrons. In the photoemission spectra, these so called secondary electrons give rise to a structureless background with a large peak at very low energies. Electron mean free path of the photoelectrons depend on its kinetic energy. Mean free path depends also on the material. The shortest mean free path is often found within the energy range of 40-100~eV 40-100~eV ; this is an important energy range as the technique is most surface sensitive here. (3) Transmission through the sample surface Refraction effects occur when the electrons passes through the sample surface due to the potential change arising from the symmetry breaking at the surface. The parallel component of the electron momentum is conserved in this process. \\textbf{k}_{\\parallel}^{int} = \\textbf{k}_{\\parallel}^{ext} \\pm \\textbf{G} \\textbf{k}_{\\parallel}^{int} = \\textbf{k}_{\\parallel}^{ext} \\pm \\textbf{G} Photoemission processes where the addition of the reciprocal vector, that is not perpendicular to the sample surface, is involved, are called Umklapp process which gives rise to extra final state bands.

So that at elevated temperature our constituent element, or the product compound do not get oxidized. Later we need a furnace with a temperature gradient. We heat the furnace to a temperature more than the melting temperature of the elements. At that temperature the compound is formed which is in molten form. We keep the melt at that temperature sufficient time (1 day) chemical reaction to complete. We start cooling the melt very slowly, say, at a rate of 1 ~^{\\circ}C/hour ~^{\\circ}C/hour so that we allow enough time for crystallization. Here we try to use some sort of temperature gradient so that the crystallization starts at the tip of the pointed/sharp tip crucible. It promotes a single nucleation and grow it in a bigger single crystal. Once the temperature of the melt becomes less than the melting point of the compound, i.e., all the melt becomes solid, we can switch off the furnace in order to quickly cool down to room temperature.","title":"Bridgman method"},{"location":"crystal-growth/crystal-growth/","text":"Crystal growth Let us think about the natural formation of crystals.

Some of you have seen the quartz crystal, or some beautiful crystalline stones. Crystals grow in nature; they can even grow in our body. For example, gallstones, kidney stones, they are all single crystals. So what is the definition of single crystal? We call a piece of solid is single crystal, if it is made up of repeated translation of a pattern unit. We call this pattern unit basis, which may be a single atom or a group of atoms. The repetition is continued throughout the entire solid and in three dimensions. Ideally, there should be no grain boundaries or any impurity present in a single crystal. Size of the solid has to be much larger compared to the size of the pattern unit. Size of the pattern units are in the order of few angstroms, while we consider the size of a bulk single crystal is of the order of millimeter or centimeter. Why is single crystal formed? Why the atoms gather in a regular pattern? Because this particular arrangement gives the system lowest possible energy. How can we say that a piece of solid is a single crystal? The repeated arrangement of atoms in a crystal can be experimentally verified by x-ray diffraction. Laue x-ray diffraction pattern (which we will discuss later in detail) lets us find out the symmetry of the atomic arrangement, and thus determining the crystal structure. Also, the internal geometry of a crystal shows up in many ways. The binding force of atoms in a solid is anisotropic; the binding force of atoms is stronger in certain directions while weaker in some other directions. Therefore, there are some particular planes along which the crystal can be broken very easily. These are called cleavage planes. When a crystal is cracked or broken, it breaks along the cleavage planes. So when we see a piece of Sugar or Salt, it may not be a perfect cube, but the angle between the faces are always exactly 90 degree. Another reason the internal geometry shows up at the surface, is because how the crystals grow. Imagine a crystal is growing out of a liquid solution. There are atoms floating all around, and finally settling down in the growing crystal when it finds a position of least energy. You can appreciate certain direction in which the crystal will grow faster than some other directions, therefore growing into some kind of geometrical shape.

Because of these reasons the outer shape of a crystal reflects some of the internal character of the atomic arrangement.","title":"How can we say that a piece of solid is a single crystal?"},{"location":"electronic-structure/bloch-theorem/","text":"Bloch theorem","title":"Bloch theorem"},{"location":"electronic-structure/bloch-theorem/#bloch-theorem","text":"","title":"Bloch theorem"},{"location":"electronic-structure/tight-binding/","text":"Tight binding model We can derive the electronic structure of a crystal based on these assumptions. In tight binding model, the crystal potential is assumed to be strong. When an electron is captured by an atomic core, it stays there for long time before tunnelling to the next atomic core. Most of the time, the electron is tightly bound to its atomic core. Tight binding model is suitable description of low lying narrow bands. In such cases, the cell radius is much smaller than the lattice constant (or inter-atomic distance), e.g., the d-orbitals of transition metals.","title":"Tight binding"},{"location":"electronic-structure/tight-binding/#tight-binding-model","text":"We can derive the electronic structure of a crystal based on these assumptions.
