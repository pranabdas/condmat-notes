Condensed matter physics is a branch of physics where we study about the condensed or solid state (as opposed to gaseous states) of matter. We are surrounded by various matter. They exist broadly in three different forms; gaseous, solid, and liquid. In case of gaseous matter, the molecules are sparsely distributed. The forces between them are not strong enough to hold them together. In case of liquid and solid matter, the density of molecules are higher. The forces among among the molecules is strong enough to hold them together. Condensed matter Physics deals with such states of matter where the attraction among the molecule is strong. Here, we will specifically focus only on the solid forms of matter. In few cases, we will discuss liquid phases as well, when we will learn about the liquid crystals (we all heard about the LCD or liquid crystal display in our mobile phones, laptops, and TV screens). Unlike in gaseous or liquid states, the constituent atoms/molecules in solid state are ordered, they do not move randomly. However, the atoms have thermal vibration with respect to their equilibrium position inside the solid. When we have a large number of atoms or molecules (of the order of 10^{23} 10^{23} molecules per cm^3 cm^3 ) together and the interaction or attraction among them is very strong, they bond together. Often the atoms (or group of atoms) arrange themselves in a repeated configuration and form crystal structure. Why study condensed matter? The world around us is made up of solid materials. Some are useful. We need to understand solid materials. We need to understand them in order to used them for a particular application. For example, we use copper wire for electrical conduction. Silicon is used as transistors in our computers including mobile phones. Liquid crystals are used in digital display, and so on. Are we interested in finding the material for next generation of electronics? Then we need to study condensed matter physics. We need to understand the structure of the material. We need to understand their electronic, mechanical and thermal properties.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"introduction/#what-is-condensed-matter-physics","text":"Condensed matter physics is a branch of physics where we study about the condensed or solid state (as opposed to gaseous states) of matter.

Whether a solid is insulating, semiconducting, metallic, or superconducting, or it is transparent, or shows a distinct color, is determined by the electronic structure of the solid. The classical properties, like thermal conductivity and heat capacity are determined by the electronic structure. A detailed understanding of the electronic structure through microscopic investigations, along with theoretical analysis, is necessary in understanding and development of new materials allowing for detailed control of the properties. The electronic states in a material is described by the electron energy, momentum and spin. Photoemission spectroscopy: Photoemission spectroscopy is the most powerful, and the only tool available to directly probe the electronic structure of a material. Photoemission spectroscopy is based on the principle of photo-electric effect, in which the sample under investigation is irradiated with a beam of photon. If the energy of the incident photon (h\\nu) (h\\nu) is large enough for the electron to overcome its binding energy and the work function of the solid, an electron is emitted from the system, and can be detected by an electron spectrometer. The electron spectrometer determines the kinetic energy of this electron detected in a particular angle. The angular information is directly related to the momentum information. This is how we can learn about the electronic bands inside the material. Schematic of the photoemission process. The density of states of outgoing electrons is proportional to that of the material. This schematic is taken from the Hufner's book. Let us consider a material which has this electronic structure: it has two core levels, and valence band near the Fermi energy. Now, if we measure the intensity distribution of photo emitted electrons as a function of electron kinetic energy, we would see something like this. It is straight forward that the photoemission intensity is proportional the density of electronic states of the material, of course, the spectra is broadened due to the finite resolution of the experimental technique. What is angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy or more commonly abbreviated as ARPES? The basic principle of photoemission spectroscopy is based on the photoelectric effect. In the process of photoelectric effect, the energy of a photon is absorbed by an electron, if the incident photon has enough energy i.e., if the electron gains enough energy, the electron is emitted from the material to the vacuum. We collect the photo emitted electrons in an electron analyzer which determines the kinetic energy of the electrons and records in which angle the electrons are emitted from the surface. Before the photon is absorbed by the electron, it may travel a finite distance inside the material. After the photon is absorbed by the electron, the electron can travel in all direction, however we can detect only the electrons that are coming out of the surface. Also, the mean free path of electron inside a solid is very small. It depends on the kinetic energy of the electron. In UV range, the typical mean free path is of the order of few angstrom. That is why photoemission spectroscopy in the UV range is extremely surface sensitive. Now, the most important question is what information can we obtain about the material by analyzing the energy and angle of emission of the photo-emitted electrons. In every process, the total energy and momentum of a system is conserved. From the energy conservation we can determine the binding energy of the electronic state from where the electron is photo-excited. And from the momentum conservation, we can determine the momentum vector of the electronic state. Therefore, we can effectively map the bandstructure of a material by ARPES. This single particle assumption of the photoemission process is simplified. In a real material, the electrons are not independent free particles. They are subject to many body interaction. Therefore, interpreting the band structure from the observed photoemission spectra is not often trivial.

The most commonly used model for the interpretation of photoemission spectra in solids is the so-called three-step model. It breaks up the complicated photoemission process into three steps: the excitation of the photoelectron, its passage through the solid to the surface and its penetration through the surface into the vacuum, where it is detected. Photo-excitation: The probability of electronic transition from the initial state \\mid\\psi_i> \\mid\\psi_i> representing the occupied valence state or core level to a final state \\mid\\psi_f> \\mid\\psi_f> due to the absorption of the photon (of energy h\\nu h\\nu ) can be derived from the first order perturbation theory. According to the Fermi's golden rule, this transition probability is given by: W = \\mid <\\psi_f \\mid \\textbf{H}' \\mid \\psi_i>\\mid ^2 \\delta(E_f \u2212 E_i \u2212 h\\nu) W = \\mid <\\psi_f \\mid \\textbf{H}' \\mid \\psi_i>\\mid ^2 \\delta(E_f \u2212 E_i \u2212 h\\nu) where \\textbf{H}' \\textbf{H}' is the perturbation due to the photon. The \\delta \\delta -function ensures the energy conservation. E_{bin} + W_\u03d5 + E_{kin} = h\\nu E_{bin} + W_\u03d5 + E_{kin} = h\\nu The binding energy of the electron in the initial state can be mapped once the kinetic energy of the photo-emitted electron is known. The second conservation rule in the photo-excitation process is the momentum conservation. In the solid, the momentum conservation can be expressed as, \\textbf{k}_f = \\textbf{k}_i \\pm \\textbf{G} \\textbf{k}_f = \\textbf{k}_i \\pm \\textbf{G} \\textbf{G} \\textbf{G} is the reciprocal lattice vector, and \\textbf{k}_i \\textbf{k}_i and \\textbf{k}_f \\textbf{k}_f are the initial and final state wave vectors. The momentum corresponding to the incident photon is negligible for the photon energies within the soft x-ray region or lower. A free electron cannot satisfy both the energy and momentum conservation laws and thus, cannot absorb a photon. For a free electron the energy momentum relationship is a parabola. For a given initial state, there is no final state for the direct/vertical ( \\textbf{k} \\textbf{k} -conserved) transition. At a photon energy close to soft x-rays or lower, the contribution due to spin-flip transition is negligible (<2\\times10^{\u22122}) (<2\\times10^{\u22122}) compared to spin-conserved transition. Transport of the photo-excited electrons to the sample surface A direct relation between the energy and momentum of the electrons detected outside the crystal and those inside the crystal can be established only if the electrons do not loose energy on its way to the surface. Inelastically scattered electrons are practically lost for the band structure determination. The occurrence of a cascade of inelastic scattering processes produces a large number of low energy electrons. In the photoemission spectra, these so called secondary electrons give rise to a structureless background with a large peak at very low energies. Electron mean free path of the photoelectrons depend on its kinetic energy. Mean free path depends also on the material. The shortest mean free path is often found within the energy range of 40-100~eV 40-100~eV ; this is an important energy range as the technique is most surface sensitive here. Transmission through the sample surface Refraction effects occur when the electrons passes through the sample surface due to the potential change arising from the symmetry breaking at the surface.

Here the single crystal is grown directly from it's molten form. One of the limitations of this method is that this method can be applied only to congruently melting compounds, meaning the phase in the molten form and in the solid form is the same. For this, we need to check the phase diagram of the compound. Here is a typical binary phase diagram. We put the constituent elements in a alumina crucible. Because generally alumina does not react with other metals up to a very high temperature of 1800 ~^{\\circ}C ~^{\\circ}C . It is preferable to have a sharp tip alumina crucible, in order to allow a single nucleation of crystal. Then we need to seal the crucible inside a protective tube. We can use quartz tube up to 1200 ~^{\\circ}C ~^{\\circ}C . We need to seal our crucible (with elements inside) in vacuum or in presence of inert gas. So that at elevated temperature our constituent element, or the product compound do not get oxidized. Later we need a furnace with a temperature gradient. We heat the furnace to a temperature more than the melting temperature of the elements. At that temperature the compound is formed which is in molten form. We keep the melt at that temperature sufficient time (1 day) chemical reaction to complete. We start cooling the melt very slowly, say, at a rate of 1 ~^{\\circ}C/hour ~^{\\circ}C/hour so that we allow enough time for crystallization. Here we try to use some sort of temperature gradient so that the crystallization starts at the tip of the pointed/sharp tip crucible.

Here the single crystal is grown directly from it's molten form. One of the limitations of this method is that this method can be applied only to congruently melting compounds, meaning the phase in the molten form and in the solid form is the same. For this, we need to check the phase diagram of the compound. Here is a typical binary phase diagram. We put the constituent elements in a alumina crucible. Because generally alumina does not react with other metals up to a very high temperature of 1800 ~^{\\circ}C ~^{\\circ}C . It is preferable to have a sharp tip alumina crucible, in order to allow a single nucleation of crystal. Then we need to seal the crucible inside a protective tube. We can use quartz tube up to 1200 ~^{\\circ}C ~^{\\circ}C . We need to seal our crucible (with elements inside) in vacuum or in presence of inert gas. So that at elevated temperature our constituent element, or the product compound do not get oxidized. Later we need a furnace with a temperature gradient. We heat the furnace to a temperature more than the melting temperature of the elements. At that temperature the compound is formed which is in molten form. We keep the melt at that temperature sufficient time (1 day) chemical reaction to complete. We start cooling the melt very slowly, say, at a rate of 1 ~^{\\circ}C/hour ~^{\\circ}C/hour so that we allow enough time for crystallization. Here we try to use some sort of temperature gradient so that the crystallization starts at the tip of the pointed/sharp tip crucible. It promotes a single nucleation and grow it in a bigger single crystal.

In our everyday life, we deal with single crystals. We all have seen the cubic crystals of common salt or sugar. Some of you have seen the quartz crystal, or some beautiful crystalline stones. Crystals grow in nature; they can even grow in our body. For example, gallstones, kidney stones, they are all single crystals. So what is the definition of single crystal? We call a piece of solid is single crystal, if it is made up of repeated translation of a pattern unit. We call this pattern unit basis, which may be a single atom or a group of atoms. The repetition is continued throughout the entire solid and in three dimensions. Ideally, there should be no grain boundaries or any impurity present in a single crystal. Here the size of the solid has to be much larger compared to the size of the pattern unit. Size of the pattern units are in the order of few angstroms, while we consider the size of a bulk single crystal is of the order of millimeter or centimeter or even metre. Why single crystal is formed? Why the atoms gather in a regular pattern? Because this particular arrangement gives the system lowest possible energy. How can we say that a piece of solid is a single crystal? The repeated arrangement of atoms in a crystal can be experimentally verified by x-ray diffraction. Laue x-ray diffraction pattern (which we will discuss later in detail) lets us find out the symmetry of the atomic arrangement, and thus determining the crystal structure. Also, the internal geometry of a crystal shows up in many ways. The binding force of atoms in a solid is anisotropic; the binding force of atoms is stronger in certain directions while weaker in some other directions. Therefore, there are some particular planes along which the crystal can be broken very easily. These are called cleavage planes. When a crystal is cracked or broken, it breaks along the cleavage planes. So when we see a piece of Sugar or Salt, it may not be a perfect cube, but the angle between the faces are always exactly 90 degree. Another reason the internal geometry shows up at the surface, is because how the crystals grow. Imagine a crystal is growing out of a liquid solution. There are atoms floating all around, and finally settling down in the growing crystal when it finds a position of least energy. You can appreciate certain direction in which the crystal will grow faster than some other directions, therefore growing into some kind of geometrical shape. Because of these reasons the outer shape of a crystal reflects some of the internal character of the atomic arrangement.","title":"Single crystal"},{"location":"crystal-structure/single-crystal/#single-crystal","text":"If want to quantitatively calculate various physical properties of a material, e.g., their electronic structure or heat capacity, we need to know about its crystal structure; how the atoms and molecules are arranged inside the material.

Therefore, there are some particular planes along which the crystal can be broken very easily. These are called cleavage planes. When a crystal is cracked or broken, it breaks along the cleavage planes. So when we see a piece of Sugar or Salt, it may not be a perfect cube, but the angle between the faces are always exactly 90 degree. Another reason the internal geometry shows up at the surface, is because how the crystals grow. Imagine a crystal is growing out of a liquid solution. There are atoms floating all around, and finally settling down in the growing crystal when it finds a position of least energy. You can appreciate certain direction in which the crystal will grow faster than some other directions, therefore growing into some kind of geometrical shape. Because of these reasons the outer shape of a crystal reflects some of the internal character of the atomic arrangement.","title":"How can we say that a piece of solid is a single crystal?"}]}
