The task is to measure the energy and momentum of the photoemitted electrons.

An electron analyzer contains three main parts:

**1. Electrostatic lens system:** which select the emission angle and focus the
electrons on the entrance slit of the analyzer.

**2. Energy analyzer:** typical analyzers are hemispherical. A potential
difference is set between two hemispheres. The electrons transmission through
the analyzer is determined by the potential difference between the two
hemispheres and the electron kinetic energy.

**3. Electron detector:** it maybe an electron multipliers or two-dimensional
channel plates.
