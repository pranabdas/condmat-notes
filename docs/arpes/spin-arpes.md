### VLEED spin detector
The basic principle is we put the photoemitted electrons over a magnetized VLEED
(Very Low Energy Electron Diffraction) target, then count the intensity of
reflected electrons. Next we reverse the magnetization of VLEED target, and
measure the intensity of reflection again. From the asymmetry between these two
intensity value, one can obtain the spin polarization of the photoemitted
electrons, and therefore the spin polarization of electronic bands inside the
materials.

A preoxidized Fe (001)-p(1X1)-O is used as a VLEED target. Other non-oxidized
targets degrade relatively quickly.

At photon energy in the soft x-ray range or lower, the contribution due to
spin-flip transition is negligible $(< 2 \times 10^{âˆ’2})$ compared to
spin-conserved transition.
