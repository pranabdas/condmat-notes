title: s- and p-polarized light
---

If the electric field of incident light is in plane (parallel) with the plane of
incidence, we call the light is p-polarized. Incidence plane is the plane formed
by propagation vector and the surface normal. On the other hand, if the electric
field of probing light is perpendicular to the plane of incidence, the light is
s-polarized.
