In this method, a high energy beam of electron beam is collimated over the
sample, which ejects the core orbital electrons from the elements present is the
compound. Since the compound is electrically grounded, another secondary
electron makes transition to this empty state emitting a characteristic x-ray.
Then by identifying the wavelength of the characteristic x-ray, we can identify
the elements present in the compound, and by analyzing the relative intensity of
various characteristic wavelengths, we can determine the relative ratio of
various elements present in the compound.
