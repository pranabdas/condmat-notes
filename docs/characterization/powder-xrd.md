title: Powder X-ray diffraction
---
Powder X-ray diffraction technique can be used to characterize the composition
and phase of a material.

Powder x-ray diffraction: the powder of a material in order to make sure that
all possible crystallographic planes are randomly oriented meaning for a
microscopic region all planes are equally probable.

A monochromatic beam of x-ray beam is collimated over the powder sample at an
incidence angle $(\theta)$, and the reflected intensity is collected at
$(2\theta)$. Once the condition:

$$
2d~\sin(\theta) = n\lambda
$$

is satisfied, we will have a diffraction peak. Here the $\lambda$ is fixed, we
determine the $\theta$, so we can find the $d$, the inter-planner distance.
Comparing the set of different inter-planner distances, we can identify the
lattice constants.

To make it easier, there are also databases of powder XRD pattern for all known
compounds, and we can compare them with the help of a software application.
