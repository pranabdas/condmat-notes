title: Metal Insulator Transitions
---

If a material has vanishingly small electrical conductivity when a weak
electrostatic field is applied at zero temperature, we classify it as insulator.
Electrons are responsible of the flow of charge in a material, which are
subjected to the Coulomb interaction with ions and other electrons. The first
class of insulators are the band insulators which can be understood in terms of
single electrons that interact with the electrostatic field of the ions.

On the other hand, there is another class of insulators where the insulating
behavior is understood as a many-electron cooperative phenomena. These type of
insulators are Mott insulators.
