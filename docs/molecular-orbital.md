### Molecular Orbital Basics 
A molecular orbital is formed by overlap/hybridization of atomic orbitals of different atoms. Likewise, we obtain atomic orbitals (1s, 2s, 2p) by solving the Schrödinger equation, we obtain the molecular orbitals ($1\sigma$, $1\sigma^*$, $2\sigma$, $2\sigma^*$, $1\pi_a$, $1\pi_b$) by solving the Schrödinger equation for H<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup> molecule (two protons and one electron). For a molecule, we can express the electronic configuration in terms of molecular orbitals following Pauli exclusion principle. 

For example, Li<sub>2</sub> is expressed as: $(1\sigma)^2 (1\sigma^*)^2 (2\sigma)^2$. 

Boding order = [(number of bonding electrons) - (number of anti-bonding electrons)]/2

Li<sub>2</sub> has bonding order (4 - 2)/2 = 1. Higher the boding order, more stable the molecule is.
