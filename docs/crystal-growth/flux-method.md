title: Flux method or high temperature solution growth method
sidebar_label: Flux method

This method is similar to growth of CuSO<sub>4</sub> from its liquid solution.
Where we dissolve CuSO<sub>4</sub> in the water solution. We gradually add
CuSO<sub>4</sub> in the water. At one point we cannot add anymore
CuSO<sub>4</sub> once the solution becomes saturated. We can heat the solution,
and add more amount of CuSO<sub>4</sub>. Now if we allow the solution to cool
down, the extra amount of CuSO<sub>4</sub> tries to solidify. And if we do it
slowly, they solidify in a crystalline form.

In our case, we are interested in growing metallic single crystals. We need to
find a good solvent for metals (water cannot dissolve metals). But there are
metals, which can dissolve another metal. For example, tin (Sn) is a good
solvent of many other metals. The melting point of tin is 230&nbsp;째C.
Generally, we take the elements and flux in the ratio (atomic) of 5% : 95%. We
take everything in a alumina crucible, then seal in the vacuum inside a quartz
tube., and heat up to about 700 - 900&nbsp;째C (depending on the compound we want
to grow single crystal). We hold the melt at highest temperature for several
hours for proper homogenization. Then we cool down very slowly, say at a rate of
1&nbsp;째C/hour, below the melting point of the compound we are growing.

If we cool down to room temperature, the single crystal will be inside the solid
tin. In order to separate the crystal from the tin, we need to heat it about
300&nbsp;째C, and decant the molten tin by using  a centrifuge.
