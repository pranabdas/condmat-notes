### Tight binding model 

We can derive the electronic structure of a crystal based on these assumptions. In tight binding model, the crystal potential is assumed to be strong. When an electron is captured by an atomic core, it stays there for long time before tunnelling to the next atomic core. Most of the time, the electron is tightly bound to its atomic core. 

Tight binding model is suitable description of low lying narrow bands. In such cases, the cell radius is much smaller than the lattice constant (or inter-atomic distance), e.g., the d-orbitals of transition metals.
