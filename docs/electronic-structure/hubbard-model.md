title: Hubbard Model
---

The greatest success of band theory of solids is that it can classify a large
number of crystalline solids as metals or insulators. However, band theory fails
in some cases because it ignores correlation effects (electron-electron
repulsions). Since a band with orbital degeneracy $n$ can hold $2n$ electrons
per unit cell, it is necessary to have an even number of electrons per unit cell
to fully occupy all the bands. Therefore, there are an odd number of electrons
per unit cell, the material cannot be an insulator.

The Hubbard model is the simplest many-body Hamiltonian which describes two
opposing tendencies:
- The kinetic energy (electron hopping) acts to delocalize the electrons into
itinerant (Bloch) states, leading to metallic behavior.
- The electron-electron interaction (approximated here by the onsite Coulomb
interaction) wants to localize the electrons onto sites.

### Metal Insulator Transitions

If a material has vanishingly small electrical conductivity when a weak
electrostatic field is applied at zero temperature, we classify it as insulator.
Electrons are responsible of the flow of charge in a material, which are
subjected to the Coulomb interaction with ions and other electrons. The first
class of insulators are the band insulators which can be understood in terms of
single electrons that interact with the electrostatic field of the ions.

On the other hand, there is another class of insulators where the insulating
behavior is understood as a many-electron cooperative phenomena. These type of
insulators are Mott insulators.
