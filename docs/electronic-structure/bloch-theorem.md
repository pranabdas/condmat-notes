In a crystalline solid, the potential experienced by an electron is periodic.

$$
V(x) = V(x + a)
$$

where $a$ is the crystal period/ lattice constant. In such a periodic potential,
the one electron solution of the Schr√∂dinger equation is given by the plane
waves modulated by a function that has the same periodicity as that of the
lattice:

$$
\psi(x) = u_k(x) e^{\pm ikx}
$$

Where, $u_k(x) = u_k(x + a)$

$$
\psi(x + a) = e^{iKa} \psi(x)
$$

$$
|\psi(x+a)|^2 = |\psi(x)|^2
$$

Applying boundary condition: $\psi(x + Na) = \psi(x)$, and that implies:

$$
K = \frac{2\pi n}{Na},  (n = 0, \pm 1, \pm 2, \dots)
$$

Such a periodic potential can be modelled by a Dirac comb (Dirac delta potential
at each lattice point) or Kronig-Penney model where we have finite square well
potential.
