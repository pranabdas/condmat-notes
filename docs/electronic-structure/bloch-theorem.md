### Bloch theorem
In a crystalline solid, the potential experienced by an electron is periodic. 

$$ V(x) = V(x +a) $$

where *a* is the crystal period. In such a periodic potential, the one electron solution of the Schr√∂dinger equation is given by the plane waves modulated by a function that has the same periodicity as that of the lattice:

$$ \psi(x) = \exp(\pm ikx) u_k(x) $$ 

Where, $$ u_k(x) = u_k(x + a) $$
