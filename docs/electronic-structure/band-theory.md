The first quantum theory of electronic behavior in solid is Sommerfeld theory,
which treat electrons as free gas, and do not include the underlying ionic field
and the electron-electron interaction. Band theory is the next step, which take
the ion field into consideration. The greatest success of band theory is its
ability to explain the metal and insulator. Insulation corresponds to fully
occupied band while metals are partially filled. These partially unoccupied
bands can readily be occupied upon thermal excitation or application of an
electric field.

In case of band theory, we apply so-called one-electron approximation, where the
total wave function for the system is given by a combination of wave functions,
each of which involves the coordinates of only one electron. The field seen by a
given electron is assumed to be that of the fixed nuclei plus some average field
produced by the charge distribution of all other electrons. The problem
essentially involves a potential field which has the same periodicity as the
crystal field. Motion of electrons in a periodic potential result in energy
bands separated by forbidden regions.
