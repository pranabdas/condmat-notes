The first quantum theory of electronic behavior in solid is Sommerfeld theory,
which treat electrons as free gas, and do not include the underlying ionic field
and the electron-electron interaction. Band theory is the next step, which take
the ion field into consideration. The greatest success of band theory is its
ability to explain the metal and insulator. Insulation corresponds to fully
occupied band while metals are partially filled.
